# Intro to Data Analysis UD170

I created this repository in order to refresh my Python skills related to data analysis. This is where I added my solutions and notes from the following course on Udacity, [Intro to Data Analysis](https://eu.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170).

#### Overview

The course is divided into 4 parts:
- [Data Analysis Process](L1_Starter_Code.ipynb)
- [NumPy and Pandas for 1D data]()
- [NumPy and Pandas for 2D data]()
- [Final Project: Investigate a Dataset]()
